# Mobile Responsive Standards

## Overview

This document outlines responsive design practices for maintaining the 70/30 map/chat layout across compact mobile viewports while ensuring usability, accessibility, and consistency.

## 70/30 Layout

- Desktop: Map (70%) and Chat (30%) displayed side by side.
- Tablet: Reduce spacing while preserving layout proportions.
- Mobile: Display one panel at a time using a toggle.

## Responsive Breakpoints

| Device  | Width        |
| ------- | ------------ |
| Desktop | >1024px      |
| Tablet  | 769px–1024px |
| Mobile  | <=768px      |

Example:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
```

## Panel Toggles
